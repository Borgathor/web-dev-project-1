            You step into a bustling tavern and quickly realise that getting people talking won't be a problem. Just hanging around the bar you hear three separate groups talking about 
            a weird old gnome who had passed through recently with a large wagon of supplies. This matches the description you were given, what these people don't know is power the old
            gnome is hiding. If he passed through recently there's only one place he could be headed.
