        You step into a bustling tavern and quickly realise that getting people talking won't be a problem. Just hanging around the bar you hear three separate groups talking about 
        a weird old gnome who had passed through recently with a large wagon of supplies. This matches the description you were given, what these people don't know is power the old
        gnome is hiding.
