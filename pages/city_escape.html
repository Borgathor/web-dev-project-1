            After hasty exit from Oakhampton you follow the path of destruction left by the clearly overladen cart. You follow the trail to a ramshackle hut in the woods about an 
            hours walk from Oakhampton. You see the cart has been parked around on side of the building and can hear clattering noises from inside the house. Carefully opening the 
            door you see a small figure with a long mane of white hair going in several directions at once, he is clearly a gnome. The creek of the door prompts him to snap around 
            with a sharp glare "Who are you and what do you want?" he demands.
