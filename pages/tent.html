            You head towards the tent and take stock of the contents of the magicians cart. Mostly generic traveling gear with the occasional item you can't identify, presumably 
            tools of the trade. One item in particular catches your eye: a gem encrusted scroll case. Mesmerised you reach out to touch it and feel an incredible warmth as the item 
            glows bright white before releasing the energy over your shoulder hitting a nearby roof which immediately catches alight. Knowing all eyes will quickly be on you, you have a 
            split second to make a decision.
