            You arrive in the city of Oakhampton alone and make your way through the bustling streets heading for the first inn you see. After the day's travel you could do with some 
            rest but looking around you see throngs of people heading for the city center this could be a good opportunity to look for more clues about if the target is still here or 
            if not, where he has gone.
