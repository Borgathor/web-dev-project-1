            Around the market you listen to the traders selling there goods and chatting to each other with the familiarity of people who meet up on a very regular basis. Amongst the 
            good natured jokes and tale telling you hear some merchants talking about "that weirdo from last week" apparently a stranger passed through fairly recently. Knowing this 
            spot an oppertunity: wherever this stranger was going it's almost certain at least one trader will be heading in the same direction.
