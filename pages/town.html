        Seeing little help to be found around the docks you head out for the next town hoping to find an inn knowing that information flows far more easily after a pint (or three).
        You arrive to find a well built town with some good taverns to look around however you also hear about a market where you may be able to listen in on the merchants however
        the only way there is through some dark alleyways which you hear are not the safest as they go through some ruined old estates.
