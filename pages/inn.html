            Deciding to get a good night sleep, you easily get a room and head in for the night. You wake in the small hours of the morning hearing a commotion outside and get up to 
            investigate. As you step out into the street you see that the area has been subject to some major property damage. Over to one side you see a crowd of people giving 
            statements to the local guard, you make sure to cover your face to avoid recognition. You hear them talking about "Some nutter in a cart" who just came crashing through 
            in a rush to escape, at least he left you a clear trail to follow. But then again maybe the crowd will have more info.
