            As you wonder through the streets you see many stalls of festival games and small pop-up shops sellling food, drink and anything anything else masses might want to have 
            a good time. After an hour of aimless meandering you spot a crowd gathered around a cart occasionally letting out "ooo"s and "ahhh"s of wonder at some sort of display. 
            Out of idle curiosity you walk over to join the crowd and see an elderly gnome in the centre performing basic magic tricks. You recognise that these are no mere party 
            tricks done with slight of hand, this is clearly someone with some level of proficiency with magic. You watch until the end of his show when he bows out and returns to 
            the tent set up next to his cart.
