            Being a well trained combatant yourself you see little threat from these thugs. You draw your blade and take up a defensive posture. Using the narrow street to your advantage 
            you are able to confront your opponents one at a time and dispatch them. In a few moments the fight is over and you step over the fallen bodies, sheathing your blade and move 
            on with haste.
