            With the importance of your mission in the fore of your mind you cannot fail now, so with a heavy heart once the gnome turns his back you take the hilt of your weapon 
            and knock him unconscious before quickly binding and gagging him. Once the commotion outside has died down you rush the target into the cart and grab the reins of the horses 
            before driving out of the city looking as innocuous as possible.
