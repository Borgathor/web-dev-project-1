            Eventually you find a trader willing to transport you over to Oakhampton so you climb aboard and make much faster progress than you would otherwise. At one point in the trip 
            you see another cart pulled off to one side of the track with a short humanoid figure accompanying it. The trader driving your cart nods in the direction of the stranger and 
            whispers "Thats the odd ball who passed through just before me." With that piece of information your path seems fairly straight forward; you thank the driver for the lift and 
            clamber down from the cart to approach the stranger who you can now see is definitely the gnome you are looking for.
