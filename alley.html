        The alley doesn't seem that bad at first as you wind your way through until you come to a section where the path runs through a series of ruined old gates. Gathered around 
        one of them is a group of people dressed in dark clothes over light armour. "Well, well, well looks like somebody's lost". The group starts to close, drawing knives and other 
        concealed weapons. What do you do?
